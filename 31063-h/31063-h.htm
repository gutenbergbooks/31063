<h2>
Two New Moles (Genus Scalopus)<br />
from Mexico and Texas
</h2>

<p class="title"><small>BY</small><br /><br />

ROLLIN H. BAKER</p>


<p>In the spring of 1950, a field party from the University of Kansas
Museum of Natural History including J. R. Alcorn, W. J. Schaldach,
Jr., George Newton, and the author collected mammals in the
Mexican state of Coahuila. A few days were spent in the Sierra del
Carmen. One morning when examining sets for pocket gophers in
these mountains, Alcorn found a mole caught in one of the traps.
Subsequent examination discloses that this specimen belongs to a
heretofore unknown species which may be named and described as
follows:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Scalopus montanus</b> new species</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skin and skull plus body skeleton; no. 35668, Univ.
Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; Club Sierra del Carmen, 2 mi. N and 6 mi. W Piedra
Blanca, Coahuila, Mexico; 7 April 1950; obtained by J. R. Alcorn, original no.
11093.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality; probably found in other localities
in the Sierra del Carmen of northern Coahuila, Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size medium and slender for the genus (see measurements);
tail medium in length, sparsely covered with whitish hairs; claws of forefeet
slender; upper parts near (h) Buffy Brown (capitalized color terms after
Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912),
with slight rufous wash on top of head; underparts resemble upper parts but
slightly paler with longitudinal band of near (14) Sudan Brown extending
from chin posteriorly to and around base of tail, less intense on breast; skull
small, arched, and relatively slender especially across mastoidal region; posterior
part of cranium depressed; foramen magnum low when viewed from rear; external
pterygoid region not greatly expanded; teeth small, especially upper third
molar.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From <i>Scalopus aquaticus</i>, of which ten subspecies have been
seen including those of significant geographic position, <i>S. montanus</i> differs in:
Skull slenderer, less angular and relatively narrower across mastoidal region;
cranium arched with hind part flattened; external pterygoid region less expanded;
teeth relatively small, especially last upper molar. From <i>S. inflatus</i>,
known to me from Jackson's description (N. Amer. Fauna, 38:53-54, pls.
2, 3, September 30, 1915), <i>S. montanus</i> differs in: Skull less angular and
slenderer, prelachrymal region not inflated; zygomata slenderer.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>S. montanus</i> is known from a single specimen, which
represents the second known occurrence of the genus <i>Scalopus</i> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Mexico. The other occurrence is that of <i>S. inflatus</i> in the state of
Tamaulipas. <i>S. montanus</i> is geographically isolated in mountainous
country from other species of <i>Scalopus</i>. Ten of the recognized subspecies
of <i>S. aquaticus</i> were available for examination and descriptions
of others were studied. It was found that the number and
magnitude of the differences separating any one of these subspecies
from an adjoining one was less than those separating <i>S. montanus</i>
from <i>S. a. texanus</i> and <i>S. a. intermedius</i>, which are, geographically,
closest to <i>S. montanus</i>. <i>S. montanus</i> seems not to be closely related
to <i>S. inflatus</i> of Tamaulipas. <i>S. montanus</i> is given specific rank
because of the great degree of difference between it and its nearest
relatives, and because of its geographically isolated position.</p>

<p>The specimen of <i>S. montanus</i> was taken in a tunnel found by digging
away a mound thought to be that of the pocket gopher,
<i>Thomomys sturgisi</i>. A trap set in one direction in the tunnel caught
the mole; a trap set in the other direction in the tunnel was later
covered with soil, evidently by a gopher. After the capture a
thorough inspection of the area revealed no "raised" tunnels, typical
of <i>Scalopus</i>. A series of <i>Thomomys</i> was taken in this area in sets
placed in tunnels found under similar mounds. This locality was
near the headquarters of the Club Sierra del Carmen in a parklike
stand of oak timber in a ca&ntilde;on, at an elevation of 4950 ft. as
recorded by our altimeter. The plant association was judged to be
characteristic of the Upper Sonoran Life-zone, not far below the beginning
of the Transition Life-zone. The area was heavily grazed
by goats, hogs and horses and had little grass or other ground cover
under the trees. The soil in this ca&ntilde;on was not deep and consisted
of a rocky, marly mixture, pale red in color, evidently produced by
weathering of the reddish volcanic rocks bordering the ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>The Sierra del Carmen is a high, igneous range, surrounded for
the most part by Lower Sonoran plains and desert. Zoologically,
these mountains are poorly known. Few collectors have been in
the area; most of these have been afforded accommodations through
the Club Sierra del Carmen (Carmen Mountain Hunting Club), the
members of which have been especially interested in assisting
naturalists. Several kinds of mammals are known only from this
"biological island" including the pocket gopher mentioned above
and the shrew, <i>Sorex milleri</i>. The finding of a mole in the higher
elevations of this range suggests that moles may occur in other
mountainous areas of Mexico.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Assistance with field work is acknowledged from the Kansas University
Endowment Association.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;The adult, male holotype measures as follows: Total length,
150; tail vertebrae, 27; hind foot, 20; greatest length (of skull), 32.2; palatilar
length, 13.8; mastoidal breadth, 16.2; interorbital breadth, 7.0; maxillary
tooth-row, 11.3; greatest depth of skull including auditory bullae, 9.4; weight,
38.6 grams.</p>

<p><i>Specimen examined.</i>&mdash;One, from the type locality.</p></div>

<p>In studying <i>Scalopus aquaticus texanus</i>, I noted that Allen (Bull.
Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:221, April 29, 1891) based the original description
on a single, unsexed specimen taken in Presidio County,
Texas, by Wm. Lloyd in September, 1887. Later, Allen wrote (Bull.
Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:200, August 18, 1893) that a series of moles
from Rockport, Aransas County, Texas, agreed essentially with the
type. True (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 19:22, December 21, 1896)
believed that the type was actually from Aransas County rather than
Presidio County. This belief was shared by later workers. In
checking the literature, I find that the collector of the type, Wm.
Lloyd, who was obtaining specimens for George B. Sennett at the
time, took other mammals in September as well as in October of
1887 in Presidio County (see Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
3:221, 223, 224, April 29, 1891) and birds there in June of 1887 (see
Sennett, Auk, 5:43, January, 1888). I can find no evidence that
Lloyd collected in or near Aransas County in 1887 and see no reason
for doubting that the locality, Presidio County, as written on the
original label of the type of <i>S. a. texanus</i> is correct. Mr. M. J. Carroll
of the Texas State Historical Association advises me that in 1887,
Presidio County was reduced to its present size by the creation of
Brewster and Jeff Davis counties. Lloyd might have taken the mole
in any one of these three Trans-Pecos counties. Even so, these
counties are widely separated geographically from the range of other
moles designated as <i>S. a. texanus</i> (see Davis, Amer. Midl. Nat.,
27:386, March, 1942). The taking of <i>S. montanus</i> in the Sierra del
Carmen immediately south of Trans-Pecos Texas leads me to think
that Lloyd's mole might have been taken in a mountainous region
within one of the three counties mentioned above. A description of
<i>Scalopus aquaticus texanus</i> Allen follows:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Scalopus aquaticus texanus</b> Allen</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="i4"><i>Scalops argentatus texanus</i> Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:221,
April 29, 1891.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Sex unknown, adult, skin no. 3488, skull no. 2740, Amer. Mus. Nat.
Hist.; Presidio County, Texas; September, 1887, obtained by Wm. Lloyd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Limits of range in Trans-Pecos Texas unknown.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small; rostrum heavy and broad; lower jaws heavy; palatine
space wide with upper tooth-rows arched laterally; teeth large, especially
fourth premolar and molars.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From adults of comparable age from Rockport, Aransas
County, Texas, <i>S. a. texanus</i> differs in: Rostrum broader and heavier; lower
jaws heavier; palatine space wider, with upper tooth-rows more arched laterally;
individual teeth in both jaws larger, especially fourth premolar and molars.
From <i>S. a. intermedius</i>, which is geographically nearest to the northeast (adult
specimens from Meade, Clark and Barber counties, Kansas, and Dewey County,
Oklahoma), <i>S. a. texanus</i> differs in: Size smaller; rostrum less massive and
shorter; tooth-row shorter.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The type has been previously examined by True
(<i>op. cit.</i>:44). The skin is faded and of little taxonomic worth. The
anterior part of the skull is present along with both upper tooth-rows
and most of the lower jaws. The teeth are well worn, indicative of
old adulthood. In size, <i>S. a. texanus</i> appears closest to moles from
southern Texas (Rockport) which previously were assigned to the
subspecies <i>Scalopus aquaticus texanus</i>. The tooth-rows are of the
same length, but the individual teeth of <i>S. a. texanus</i> are significantly
larger.</p>

<p>The moles in southern Texas previously ascribed to <i>Scalopus
aquaticus texanus</i> seem to be without a name and may be known as
follows:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Scalopus aquaticus alleni</b> new subspecies</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="i4"><i>Scalops texanus</i>, Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:200, August 18,
1893.</p>

<p class="i4"><i>Scalops aquaticus texanus</i> True, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 19:21, December
21, 1896.</p>

<p class="i4"><i>Scalopus aquaticus texanus</i> Jackson, N. Amer. Fauna, 38:50, September
30, 1915; Miller, U. S. Nat. Mus., Bull. 128:15, April 29, 1924; Davis,
Amer. Midl. Nat., 27:386, March, 1942.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skin no. 7189, skull no. 5788, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.;
Rockport, Aransas County, Texas; 29 January 1893; obtained by H. P. Attwater.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Southern Texas, north to Bexar County and east to Refugio County
(see Davis, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small; according to Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>), "... length
of hind foot seldom more than 19 mm.; total length seldom more than 140 mm.
Skull small and flat, seldom exceeding 33 mm. in occipitonasal length and
seldom equalling 10 mm. in depth; maxillary breadth usually less than 10 mm.;
alveolar length of maxillary tooth row seldom more than 10.5 mm."</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From <i>S. a. cryptus</i>, geographically adjacent to the east, <i>S. a.
alleni</i> differs in: Size smaller; color paler; skull smaller and flatter. From
<i>S. a. intermedius</i>, geographically adjacent to the north, <i>S. a. alleni</i> differs in:
Size smaller; skull smaller and flatter with shorter tooth-row (see
Davis, <i>op cit.</i>:384, 385). For comparison with <i>S. a. texanus</i>,
see account of that subspecies.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This mole is named in honor of Dr. J. A. Allen in
recognition for his work on Texas mammals. Grateful acknowledgment
is made to those in charge of the collection of Recent mammals
in the American Museum of Natural History for permitting me to
examine the moles from Aransas County and the type specimen of
<i>Scalops argentatus texanus</i> Allen.</p>
